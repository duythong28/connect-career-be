Our amazing users are students, professionals, and productivity lovers. Many of them have learning differences like dyslexia and ADHD, while many just want to read faster and listen on the go. With Speechify you can turn any book, document, or website into audio, and listen while you’re in the car, doing laundry, walking your dog, making dinner, working out, skydiving—whatever your daily routine is! Speechify also powers Medium, the Star Tribune, The Direct, and more. Easily add text-to-speech to your website. Cliff Weitzman, our fearless CEO, founded Speechify in 2017 in a dorm room at Brown University so he could share with others the incredible text-to-speech software he’d been working on. Cliff has dyslexia and he was frustrated with how much time and energy it took for him to read. Advanced TTS technology was a total gamechanger, it allowed him to finish his readings 3x faster than a normal reader and to better comprehend and retain information.

    "job_summary": "Want to make fun games that have an impact on people’s everyday lives? We’ve got an opening. Sqkii is known for our flagship #HuntTheMouse campaign that gives away cold, hard cash to players who find hidden coins. If you’ve seen Singaporeans squatting in random spots, walking around with metal detectors, or sticking their heads under tables… you’ve probably seen one of our games in action. Besides our hunts, we also create custom games that bring players on other real life adventures and virtual journeys through their mobile screens — they’re also super cool, just ask the mouse. Right now, we’re bringing #HuntTheMouse beyond the shores of Singapore to other cities across Asia-Pacific. We’ve visited 6 other cities so far, hidden a million dollars in Singapore in 2024, and oh boy do we have big plans ahead. Big plans = bigger team, so we’re on the hunt (ha) for someone who wants to hop onto this thrilling ride. As our Game Designer, you’ll work your magic behind the scenes to bring our current and future games to wild new heights. Fair warning — we’re open to ideas from literally anyone in the team, so you can expect to turn some pretty absurd plans into legit game thingamajigs. If you love games, understand games, and can’t wait to create some of the most exciting ones to date, we (and our Game Design team) are 200% ready to meet you. See below for more details and hit us up for a chat anytime. P.S. After you’ve applied, we’ll send over some secret tasks for you to try your hand at before we arrange for a virtual chat! What you'll be doing: Design and develop gamification strategies to enhance user engagement and motivation. Create and balance game mechanics, gameplay loops, and game economy systems that achieve stakeholders' objectives without compromising the fun. Conduct research and analysis on game industry trends and best practices. Collaborate with other stakeholders, including UX/UI designers, developers, and marketing team, to produce high quality games.

At UNICEF, we are committed, passionate, and proud of what we do for as long as we are needed. Promoting the rights of every child is not just a job – it is a calling. UNICEF is a place where careers are built. We offer our staff diverse opportunities for professional and personal development that will help them reinforce a sense of purpose while serving children and communities across the world.

Visit our website to learn more about what we do at UNICEF. Please click the link for further information about UNICEF Viet Nam: https://www.unicef.org/vietnam/ For every child, an opportunity... How can you make a difference? Purpose of Activity/Assignment: To update the trend of multidimensional child poverty in Viet Nam 2020 to 2024 and analyze the factors associated with child poverty for formulating policy recommendations on sustainable poverty reduction. Background Viet Nam has made significant progress in economic growth and poverty reduction over the past two decades. However, multidimensional child poverty (MDCP) remains a persistent challenge, especially amid rising inequality, climate change and rapid urbanization. Children are among the most vulnerable groups, and poverty for them is not merely a lack of income, it encompasses deprivations in essential dimensions such as education, health, nutrition, housing, sanitation, clean water, and recreation. The 2022 MDCP Report, jointly conducted by UNICEF and the National Statistics Office (NSO), shows that the national MDCP rate declined from 21.2% in 2014 to 10.7% in 2020. However, disparities remain stark: ethnic minority children (33.1%) vs. Kinh/Hoa (6.3%), rural children (13%) vs. urban children (6%), and children in the Central Highlands and Northern Mountains face the highest MDCP rates. Moreover, 74% of multidimensionally poor children were not classified as poor by local authorities, limiting their access to social protection and services. With NSO currently releasing new data of Viet Nam Household Living Standard Survey 2024 and updating MDCP rate, there is a need for a full-fledged analysis that provides deeper disaggregation (e.g., by province, by number of deprivations, etc.) and factors associated with child poverty to inform more targeted and effective policy responses. Specific Objectives Analyze the MDCP trend over the period 2020-2024. Estimate MDCP rates with full disaggregation. Identify and analyze factors associated with MDCP. Develop policy recommendations based on evidence to sustainably reduce child poverty. Research Questions What is the MDCP rate of 2024 of Viet Nam and of each province (for 63 provinces and newly merged 34 provinces) and MDCP trend over the period of 2020-2024 at national level? What are factors associated with MDCP in Viet Nam? What are policy recommendations to reduce sustainably child poverty in Viet Nam? Scope Of Work The consultant will: Review and analyze secondary data from the VHLSS 2020, 2022 and 2024 using UNDP-WB-UNICEF approach to MDCP calculation and analysis. Analyze the patterns of child poverty in each domain and aggregation. Analyze MDCP at provincial level: 63 provinces and newly merged 34 provinces. Conduct a deeper analysis of factors associated with child poverty in Viet Nam. Develop policy recommendations to reduce child poverty sustainably. Develop a full report and a summary report (both in English and Vietnamese) on key findings and policy recommendations. Methodology/approach The study will employ a quantitative, secondary data analysis approach using the datasets of VHLSS 2020, 2022 and 2024. MDCP calculation is based on the approach used in the metadata of SDG indicator 1.2 on multidimensional child poverty, which are adopted by the World Bank, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and UNICEF. More specifically, this methodological approach is underpinned by the concept of constitutive rights of poverty developed by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), i.e., constitutive rights of poverty are those that crucially require a person’s command over material and physical resources for their realization. Ethical Considerations As this is a secondary data analysis, no direct interaction with human subjects is required. However, the consultant will ensure: Confidentiality of individual and household data Responsible use of sensitive ethnic identifiers Compliance with national data protection regulations. Collaboration With NSO The consultant will collaborate with NSO for consistency in data use. The consultant is responsible for seeking assistance, if needed, for data processing. Supervision And Management The consultant will work under the direct supervision of UNICEF’s Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist and Social Policy and Governance Specialist under the overall management of UNICEF’s Chiefs of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation and Social Policy and Governance sections. He/she will ensure a participatory process that incorporates technical perspectives and guidance from the National Statistics Office.

However, multidimensional child poverty (MDCP) remains a persistent challenge, especially amid rising inequality, climate change and rapid urbanization. Children are among the most vulnerable groups, and poverty for them is not merely a lack of income, it encompasses deprivations in essential dimensions such as education, health, nutrition, housing, sanitation, clean water, and recreation.<br><br>The 2022 MDCP Report, jointly conducted by UNICEF and the National Statistics Office (NSO), shows that the national MDCP rate declined from 21.2% in 2014 to 10.7% in 2020. However, disparities remain stark: ethnic minority children (33.1%) vs. Kinh/Hoa (6.3%), rural children (13%) vs. urban children (6%), and children in the Central Highlands and Northern Mountains face the highest MDCP rates. Moreover, 74% of multidimensionally poor children were not classified as poor by local authorities, limiting their access to social protection and services.<br><br>With NSO currently releasing new data of Viet Nam Household Living Standard Survey 2024 and updating MDCP rate, there is a need for a full-fledged analysis that provides deeper disaggregation (e.g., by province, by number of deprivations, etc.) and factors associated with child poverty to inform more targeted and effective policy responses.<br><br><strong>Specific Objectives<br><br></strong><ul><li> Analyze the MDCP trend over the period 2020-2024.</li><li> Estimate MDCP rates with full disaggregation.</li><li> Identify and analyze factors associated with MDCP.</li><li> Develop policy recommendations based on evidence to sustainably reduce child poverty.<br><br></li></ul><strong>Research Questions<br><br></strong><ul><li> What is the MDCP rate of 2024 of Viet Nam and of each province (for 63 provinces and newly merged 34 provinces) and MDCP trend over the period of 2020-2024 at national level?</li><li> What are factors associated with MDCP in Viet Nam?</li><li> What are policy recommendations to reduce sustainably child poverty in Viet Nam?<br><br></li></ul><strong>Scope Of Work<br><br></strong>The consultant will:<br><br><ul><li> Review and analyze secondary data from the VHLSS 2020, 2022 and 2024 using UNDP-WB-UNICEF approach to MDCP calculation and analysis.</li><li> Analyze the patterns of child poverty in each domain and aggregation.</li><li> Analyze MDCP at provincial level: 63 provinces and newly merged 34 provinces.</li><li> Conduct a deeper analysis of factors associated with child poverty in Viet Nam.</li><li> Develop policy recommendations to reduce child poverty sustainably.</li><li> Develop a full report and a summary report (both in English and Vietnamese) on key findings and policy recommendations.<br><br></li></ul><strong>Methodology/approach<br><br></strong>The study will employ a quantitative, secondary data analysis approach using the datasets of VHLSS 2020, 2022 and 2024. MDCP calculation is based on the approach used in the metadata of SDG indicator 1.2 on multidimensional child poverty, which are adopted by the World Bank, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and UNICEF. More specifically, this methodological approach is underpinned by the concept of constitutive rights of poverty developed by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), i.e., constitutive rights of poverty are those that crucially require a person&#x2019;s command over material and physical resources for their realization.<br><br><strong>Ethical Considerations<br><br></strong>As this is a secondary data analysis, no direct interaction with human subjects is required. However, the consultant will ensure:<br><br><ul><li> Confidentiality of individual and household data</li><li> Responsible use of sensitive ethnic identifiers</li><li> Compliance with national data protection regulations.<br><br></li></ul><strong>Collaboration With NSO<br><br></strong>The consultant will collaborate with NSO for consistency in data use. The consultant is responsible for seeking assistance, if needed, for data processing.<br><br><strong>Supervision And Management<br><br></strong>The consultant will work under the direct supervision of UNICEF&#x2019;s Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist and Social Policy and Governance Specialist under the overall management of UNICEF&#x2019;s Chiefs of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation and Social Policy and Governance sections.

You will be involved in all aspects of the product including product design, platform strategy and development. Some more responsibilities include: Working closely with the Head of Engineering, the founders, PMs and designers to spec, build and iterate the platform to help solve problems for web & mobile app developers. You will be in charge of solutioning for some of our most challenging projects. While a strong grasp of front-end concepts is essential for this role, it’s just the starting point.

On a typical day, you will converse with the model on real-world engineering scenarios, verify factual accuracy and logical soundness, capture reproducible error traces, and suggest improvements to our prompt engineering and evaluation metrics. A master’s or PhD in engineering or a closely related engineering field is ideal; peer‑reviewed publications, industry experience, or hands-on engineering projects signal fit. Clear, metacognitive communication—“showing your work”—is essential. Ready to turn your engineering expertise into the knowledge base for tomorrow’s AI? Apply today and start teaching the model that will teach the world. We offer a pay range of $8-to- $65 per hour, with the exact rate determined after evaluating your experience, expertise, and geographic location.

Initial Responsibilities Testing a series of custom features in a site Building modules Translation management 3. Target Responsibilities Custom WordPress site builds – take a Photoshop file and apply the styles to a WordPress child theme, work with Beaver Builder, PHP, and WordPress child theme templates to set up custom features and layouts as needed. Modify and create new Beaver Builder modules to add support for features, complex functionality, and intricate styling that aren’t natively available. Develop and maintain custom themes with an eye towards automation and end user-friendliness Extend 3rd party plugins with WordPress hooks, template overrides, or creative solutions to accomplish time-sensitive tasks Plugin troubleshooting/problem-solving. Feature documentation. Taking screenshots and writing out steps/instructions to be used in Thinkific for course building Project debriefs – sharing your experience with a site or project build with the team. 4. Examples of tasks: Marketing needs to make customisations to their events in Beaver Builder to display an external link that they can change from the WordPress admin. You would add a custom field that shows on posts with something like Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) and then modify the Beaver Builder post feed module to display data from the ACF field on the frontend. A website with hundreds of already created posts and pages is being redesigned. You would create page templates and widgets that account for dynamic content in order to restyle existing posts in a way that ensures nothing slips through the cracks while working within the confines of the already existing website or proactively identifying new technology that would better serve the redesign and decrease redesign time. A designer you’re working with has finished their mock-up on a new site build with great UI/UX, but is unsure how to handle dynamic content within their design. You proactively suggest solutions and utilize responsive frontend best practices to ensure the website looks good on every browser and every device regardless of what the content looks like. We will use WordPress or HubSpot only so it is important to learn or be certified on these. 5.

Our team is around forty people, and growing quickly. Manufactured is a small, fast growing startup. Which means we deal with ambiguity and require a sense of ownership from all our team members. This is reflected in our core values. Our core values are: Urgency: Always act like an owner, seek help in case of delays beyond 48 hours, move quickly when you have enough information (usually 70-75%), know when to dive in if there’s a crisis, and hold true to the best possible timelines without compromising on quality, value or process. Authenticity: Be Authentic, be real, be respectful both, in front of and behind a person’s back. If you are frustrated, you’re frustrated. If you’re stuck, you’re stuck. If you’re worried, you’re worried. Let's support each other in resolving these issues. Be upfront and respectful in your conversation. We are a multi cultural, distributed, global team. Respectful authenticity in communication is critical. Contextual Ownership: Our business is as much about people and relationships as it is about technology and process. We take time to build relationships and understand the needs of our internal and external partners. Context and empathy helps us understand the “why”. We set goals and drive outcomes based on context and realities, rather than tasks and process alone. Effectiveness: Did it work? Did it solve the problem? Was it a short term hack or a long term process solution that benefits everyone? Was it something we can use to grow / move forward or was it a defensive solution. Did we meet our stakeholders’ expectations, did we exceed them? Did our stakeholders all win? Are you using your time correctly? Are you helping your team members use their time well? Are you contributing to the growth of the company?
