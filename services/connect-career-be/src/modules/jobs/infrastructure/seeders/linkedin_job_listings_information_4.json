We’re explorers, pursuing society’s most critical safety and justice issues with our ecosystem of devices and cloud software. Like our products, we work better together. We connect with candor and care, seeking out diverse perspectives from our customers, communities and each other. Life at Axon is fast-paced, challenging and meaningful. Here, you’ll take ownership and drive real change. Constantly grow as you work hard for a mission that matters at a company where you matter. Your Impact Axon is on a mission to protect life. As part of that mission, Axon Assistant is helping shape the future of how public safety professionals interact with intelligent systems — delivering real-time translation, contextual policy guidance, and AI-driven support across voice, mobile, and web platforms. Axon Assistant operates in a space where cutting-edge AI, device integrations, and mission-critical reliabilityconverge. As a Staff Software Engineer, you will be a technical leader responsible for solving some of the hardest problems in deploying AI products at scale — spanning LLM orchestration, multi-platform integration, latency-sensitive use cases, and global deployment complexity. The systems you help design will directly impact how officers make decisions in the field, increase situational awareness, and ultimately support life-saving outcomes. This is a role for someone who thrives in high-ambiguity, high-complexity environments and wants to bring structure, clarity, and momentum to deeply technical challenges. You’ll play a central role in defining architecture, driving decisions, and ensuring that our most ambitious product can be delivered with rigor, trust, and velocity. Work Location: This role is based out of our London office and follows a hybrid schedule. We rely on in-person collaboration and ask that team members work onsite Tuesdays through Fridays, with the flexibility to work remotely on Mondays, unless there is an approved workplace accommodation. We believe that connection fuels innovation, and our in-office culture is designed to foster meaningful teamwork, mentorship, and shared success. What You’ll Do Lead technical direction and architecture for key systems powering Axon Assistant across backend, mobile, and edge-device surfaces. Design and build high-performance, fault-tolerant services for AI feature delivery, real-time communication, and intelligent user interaction. Evaluate and integrate LLMs and other AI/ML models for use in production — ensuring safe, performant, and explainable application of language technologies. Own complex decision-making processes, such as model selection vs. deterministic logic, tradeoffs in latency, data retention, cost, and user trust. Work closely with PMs, Applied AI teams, and UX engineers to align technology decisions with user experience and product strategy — helping ensure that assistant-style interactions feel fluid, contextual, and intelligent. Write and review production code (Node.js, Python, or equivalent) and mentor engineers across the team in high-quality engineering practices. Lead cross-functional technical investigations, root cause analyses, and high-risk launches with ownership and clarity. Bring order and forward momentum to ambiguous and evolving requirements — without losing sight of long-term architectural health. What You Bring 10+ years of experience in software engineering, including 3+ years in Staff-level or equivalent roles. Proven experience designing and delivering complex backend systems, ideally in distributed or real-time environments. Hands-on experience building and deploying AI/ML-powered systems, especially with LLMs, NLP services, or multimodal interfaces. Deep understanding of cloud infrastructure, service reliability, and secure system design (AWS, GCP, or Azure). Advanced fluency in at least one backend language such as Node.js, Python, or Go, with a focus on scalable, testable design. Strong architectural thinking and judgment — with the ability to navigate ambiguity and drive consensus. Experience with real-world deployment constraints, including multi-region scaling, privacy compliance, and observability. Ability to influence, mentor, and lead across engineering boundaries without formal authority. Nice to Have Experience building assistant-style interfaces or integrating LLMs in production settings. Background working in regulated domains or high-trust product environments (e.g., public safety, healthcare, financial services). Contributions to open-source AI tooling or relevant community work. Familiarity with on-device compute constraints, edge inference, or hybrid client/cloud architecture. Benefits That Benefit You Competitive base salary and RSUs. Comprehensive pension plan with matching contribution Private health insurance & cash plans 30 days paid holiday + UK public holidays Enhanced maternity/paternity leave GymPass subscription Life assurance & income protection Career growth support and wellness resources Benefits listed herein may vary depending on the nature of your employment and the location where you work.

We connect with candor and care, seeking out diverse perspectives from our customers, communities and each other. Life at Axon is fast-paced, challenging and meaningful. Here, you’ll take ownership and drive real change. Constantly grow as you work hard for a mission that matters at a company where you matter. Your Impact We’re building Axon Outpost, a new frontier in public safety technology. This first-generation, first-party fixed ALPR (Automatic License Plate Recognition) device takes the proven intelligence of Axon’s body-worn and in-car systems and expands it into the off-grid domain. Solar-powered, AI-enabled, and always connected, Outpost is designed to operate autonomously in the harshest environments—transforming how law enforcement agencies and communities gather intelligence and act on threats in real time. Outpost is more than a camera—it’s a smart node in a safety network, providing situational awareness that empowers public safety professionals to protect life, solve crime, and further justice. Whether it’s tracking stolen vehicles, identifying suspects in violent crime, or strengthening community protection efforts through HOAs and enterprises, Outpost works in tandem with Axon’s suite of tools and the Fusus real-time crime center platform to deliver actionable intelligence when and where it matters most. We’re looking for a Software Product Manager to lead definition and delivery of product features across the embedded and cloud-connected software surfaces of Outpost. This is a critical role that bridges engineering, customer needs, and long-term strategy—ensuring we ship capabilities that are technically sound, operationally valuable, and scalable across future generations of the platform. What You’ll Do Location : This role is based out of our Boston or Seattle office and follows a hybrid schedule. We rely on in-person collaboration and ask that team members work onsite Tuesdays through Fridays, with the flexibility to work remotely on Mondays, unless there is an approved workplace accommodation. We believe that connection fuels innovation, and our in-office culture is designed to foster meaningful teamwork, mentorship, and shared success. Reports to : VP of Product Management Direct Reports : None Write and own software one-pagers to align stakeholders on upcoming features, including problem definition, customer value, technical context, and proposed solutions. Translate one-pagers into detailed product specifications consumable by engineering, QA, and validation teams. Collaborate cross-functionally with hardware PMs, field testing PMs, engineers, designers, and external stakeholders to build and ship features on time and to spec. Drive end-to-end software capability development from scoping to field validation to general availability. Leverage data and telemetry from devices to guide development and maintain system reliability, availability, and performance. Define and track North Star metrics for Outpost software, using them to drive roadmap decisions and feature prioritization. Contribute to and evolve the Outpost v2 product vision and roadmap, using insights from Outpost v1 launch and customer feedback. Represent the product in bug triages, software leadership syncs, and stakeholder reviews, ensuring the right balance of bug fixes, technical debt, and new features. Make data-informed decisions when possible, but confidently operate in ambiguity when necessary—resolving real constraints while pushing past imagined ones. Participate actively in post-launch support and fast-follow cycles, ensuring learnings are fed back into continuous improvement. What You Bring Bachelor’s degree in a technical field, business, or equivalent experience. 6+ years of experience as a Product Manager, ideally working on device-integrated or hardware-connected software platforms. Strong writing and documentation skills—you can clearly articulate problems, requirements, and outcomes to cross-functional teams. Proven track record of shipping software features from idea to deployment across cross-disciplinary teams.

    "job_summary": "Join Axon and be a Force for Good. At Axon, we’re on a mission to Protect Life. We’re explorers, pursuing society’s most critical safety and justice issues with our ecosystem of devices and cloud software. Like our products, we work better together. We connect with candor and care, seeking out diverse perspectives from our customers, communities and each other. Life at Axon is fast-paced, challenging and meaningful. Here, you’ll take ownership and drive real change. Constantly grow as you work hard for a mission that matters at a company where you matter. Your Impact Axon’s Fusus platform is redefining how video intelligence drives public safety and enterprise security. We believe that modern real-time crime centers should be powered by cutting-edge, AI-enabled video analytics—not constrained by hardware lock-in or legacy VMS systems. As Senior Product Manager II for AI Video Analytics, you will own the vision, roadmap, and delivery of AI-powered video capabilities in the Fusus ecosystem. Your mission is to build the most advanced, hardware-agnostic, and scalable video analytics platform in the industry—transforming how operators detect, investigate, and respond to incidents in real time. The future of video intelligence is flexible, intelligent, and open. Public safety agencies and enterprise security teams are demanding more than just storage and playback—they want real-time insights and predictive capabilities. By leading Axon’s AI Video Analytics strategy for Fusus, you’ll play a critical role in defining what the next generation of video intelligence looks like—and deliver life-saving impact at scale. You will work at the intersection of computer vision, ecosystem integration, partner enablement, and product experience. You’ll collaborate deeply with AI engineering, system integrators, city customers, and third-party camera providers to define and deliver a seamless and powerful video analytics layer—whether deployed on edge devices, in the cloud, or via hybrid models. Work Location: This role is based out of our Boston, MA office and follows a hybrid schedule. We rely on in-person collaboration and ask that team members work onsite Tuesdays through Fridays, with the flexibility to work remotely on Mondays, unless there is an approved workplace accommodation. We believe that connection fuels innovation, and our in-office culture is designed to foster meaningful teamwork, mentorship, and shared success. Reports to: Senior Director, Product Direct Reports: 0 What You’ll Do Own the end-to-end product strategy for AI video analytics within the Fusus platform. Define and prioritize product features for video object detection, classification, alerting, and rule management across partner and first-party cameras. Work closely with engineering and research teams to evaluate core vs. third-party model performance and optimize deployments across varying hardware contexts. Lead product definition for unified alert management and camera rule configuration workflows—ensuring simplicity, consistency, and scalability. Collaborate with business development and partner teams to shape the Axon-compatible video ecosystem, including integration standards and incentives. Engage directly with customers, including public safety agencies and enterprise security teams, to validate needs, shape capabilities, and refine roadmap priorities. Instrument and evaluate video analytics performance and quality across deployments, ensuring standards are upheld and product feedback is looped into development. What Success Looks Like To thrive in this role, you will need to combine technical fluency, product intuition, and a deep sense of ownership for customer outcomes. You won’t just ship features—you’ll own an experience that helps our customers protect communities with confidence. Clear delivery of a scalable, camera-agnostic AI video analytics stack that supports city-wide and enterprise-scale deployments. A unified UX for camera alert management and rule configuration that reduces training burden and drives adoption.
