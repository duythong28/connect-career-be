But this is just the beginning. It takes inventive minds with diverse skills, backgrounds, and cultures to transform 5Gs potential into world-changing technologies and products. This is the Invention Age - and this is where you come in. General Summary In this role, an intern will explore opportunities for research in post-silicon test engineering with a particular focus on testing for digital logic (stuck-at fault, transition delay fault, etc.). As this is a research-focused role, it will likely include the reviewing of published conference and journal papers in the direction of the project. Work will likely draw upon knowledge of circuit design and design-for-test, and may include the use of EDA tools like those for ATPG, diagnosis, and Static Timing Analysis. Unix will be the main interface for accessing tools and compute resources, and Python scripting will likely be used for various analysis and automation. There may also be the opportunity to design and implement low-volume data collection experiments on Automated Test Equipment. Applicants : Qualcomm is an equal opportunity employer.

But this is just the beginning. It takes inventive minds with diverse skills, backgrounds, and cultures to transform 5Gs potential into world-changing technologies and products. This is the Invention Age - and this is where you come in. General Summary Before there were smartphones or smart cities, before autonomous cars or 360° virtual reality videos, there was our technology. Headquartered in San Diego, for over 30 years Qualcomm inventions have inspired others to make the impossible, possible. From 5G to artificial intelligence, from IoT to automotive and extended reality applications, Qualcomm is inventing the technologies of an intelligently connected future, spearheading research efforts for the next global wireless standard, and collaborating with industry leaders in the wireless value chain to make this future a commercial reality. The field of generative modeling is evolving rapidly, with video diffusion emerging as a powerful paradigm for high-quality, temporally consistent video synthesis. This internship offers an exciting opportunity to explore the applicability of video diffusion models [1, 2, 3] to various downstream applications, such as image editing [6, 7] or facial reenactment [4, 5]. Responsibilities Investigate novel architectures and training strategies to improve video generation quality and efficiency. Explore conditioning mechanisms to extend existing video diffusion models to downstream applications. Generate or curate use-case specific datasets to support model development and evaluation. Implement and benchmark baseline models for comparative analysis, including thorough ablation studies. Optimize model performance with a focus on computational efficiency and scalability. The research conducted in this internship is aimed at advancing the field of generative modeling using video diffusion, with the expectation of contributing to paper submissions at top-tier conferences in the field.

But this is just the beginning. It takes inventive minds with diverse skills, backgrounds, and cultures to transform 5Gs potential into world-changing technologies and products. This is the Invention Age - and this is where you come in. General Summary Before there were smartphones or smart cities, before autonomous cars or 360° virtual reality videos, there was our technology. Headquartered in San Diego, for over 30 years Qualcomm inventions have inspired others to make the impossible, possible. From 5G to artificial intelligence, from IoT to automotive and extended reality applications, Qualcomm is inventing the technologies of an intelligently connected future, spearheading research efforts for the next global wireless standard, and collaborating with industry leaders in the wireless value chain to make this future a commercial reality. The field of 2D generative modeling is advancing rapidly, continually expanding the boundaries of image synthesis and manipulation. This internship aims to harness recent breakthroughs, particularly in 2D diffusion models [1, 2], to investigate efficient generative techniques such as few-step distillation [3, 4, 5] and high-resolution image generation [6, 7, 8]. The research will also extend into related areas including image editing, super-resolution, and restoration [9, 10, 11]. Responsibilities Research and develop innovative approaches in 2D diffusion models for generative modeling. Extend research to adjacent tasks, such as super-resolution and image restoration. Explore and implement more efficient techniques to enhance the performance of generative models, focusing on computational efficiency. Conduct implementation of baselines for comparative evaluation on benchmarks, along with thorough ablation studies. The research conducted in this internship is aimed at advancing the field of 2D generative modeling, with the expectation of contributing to paper submissions at top-tier conferences in the field.
