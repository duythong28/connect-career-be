In Grab, purpose gives us joy and habits build excellence, while harnessing the power of Technology and AI to deliver the mission of driving Southeast Asia forward by economically empowering everyone, with heart, hunger, honour, and humility. Job Description Get to Know the Team The Regional Deliveries Strategy team drives key decisions that shape the future of Grab's Food and Mart businesses across Southeast Asia. We work with country teams, product, commercial, operations, and marketing to solve complex problems, launch strategic initiatives, and unlock growth across our markets. Get to Know the Role We're hiring a Strategy Manager focused on category strategy for GrabMart , our on-demand groceries and essentials marketplace. This is not a category manager role — you won't be managing SKUs or daily P&Ls. Instead, you'll drive the strategy behind our category growth: What should we build? Where do we have gaps? How do we unlock the next phase of category expansion? You'll work regionally, across markets, to identify strategic opportunities, shape priorities, and partner with cross-functional teams to scale high-impact initiatives. You will report to the Head of Online Deliveries Strategy, and this role is based onsite in the Grab Bangkok office. The Critical Tasks You Will Perform Develop and evolve GrabMart's category strategy — identifying where and how we win across key missions (e.g. fresh, snacks, health, home). Conduct deep dives into performance data, customer needs, and competitor dynamics to shape recommendations. Design region-level strategies that are scalable, and collaborate with local teams to localize and execute them. Align with product, marketing, and commercial teams to drive cross-functional go-to-market plans for priority categories. Track impact and iterate on what works — bringing a test-and-learn mindset to category growth. Qualifications Who We Are Looking For You're curious about customers, markets, numbers, competitors, and how everything fits together. You love connecting the dots across multiple problems, teams, and data sources — and you don't stop at obvious answers. You think in first principles, ask great questions, and get energy from navigating ambiguity. You turn ideas into action — not just crafting smart plans, but driving them through to impact. What Essential Skills You Will Need A minimum of a bachelor's degree in Business Administration, Economics, Marketing, or a related field is required. 5+ years of experience in strategy-related roles — consulting, ecommerce, FMCG, retailing or similar. Experience turning insight into execution, particularly around category or customer segment strategies. Familiarity with eCommerce, retail, or marketplace models is a strong plus.
